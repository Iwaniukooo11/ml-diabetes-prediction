# Diabetes Prediction Project

This project was conducted as part of the Machine Learning course at Warsaw University of Technology.

## Goal
The primary goal of this project was to apply supervised learning techniques for classification. The business case involved creating a reliable model to assist medical centers in accurate diagnosis and predicting probabilities of type II diabetes.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, SHAP

## Scope of the Project
The project encompassed the following stages:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understanding the dataset and identifying patterns.
2. Feature Engineering (FE): Transforming and creating new features to improve model performance.
3. Model Building: Employing various classification algorithms and hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
4. Model Interpretation: Utilizing SHAP library for interpreting model predictions and feature importance.

## Results
- Achieved high ROC-AUC scores, indicating the models' effectiveness in predicting probabilities of diabetes.
- Identified significant predictors for diabetes, including general health, age, BMI, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and income.
